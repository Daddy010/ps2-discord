      Welcome to <#415955388622569492>! This is a *strictly moderated* channel for players to seek advice from this server's verified mentor roles: <@&251831780254941184>, <@&295688578611281921>, and <@&294503132313026563>. If you are not here to seek advice, please allow the tagged mentors to handle questions in this channel and refrain from answering them yourself. Memes, advice from non-mentors, and other messages that do not follow this guideline will be removed and may result in revocation of access to this channel. This includes questions answered via side-pinging from another channel. Note that mentors may take a little while to respond depending on when they're around.

      **This is a recommendation, advice, and mentoring channel** for questions like "what loadout should I use?", or "how do I get better at this?". If your question is about general game knowledge, like "what is this icon?" or "how much damage does this gun do?", consider asking it instead in <#251101848730075137> for a faster answer. Similarly, for questions about getting the game to work or other technical problems, please use <#1057779422054338632>.

      Also be sure to check the pinned messages in <#469528074560602120> for guides and other helpful links to get you started.
